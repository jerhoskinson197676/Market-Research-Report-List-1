<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal ICU Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Neonatal ICU ventilators market includes two primary types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve endotracheal intubation, providing direct airflow into the lungs, ensuring precise control for critically ill neonates. Non-invasive ventilators utilize methods like nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), delivering air through masks or nasal prongs, which minimizes trauma and discomfort. Both types are essential for supporting neonatal respiratory needs, with applications depending on the severity of the infant's condition.</p></p>
