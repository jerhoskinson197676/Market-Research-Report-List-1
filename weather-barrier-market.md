<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Weather Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impermeable</li><li>Semi-permeable</li><li>Permeable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Weather barrier market types categorize materials based on their permeability to air and moisture. Impermeable barriers prevent moisture and air transfer entirely, providing strong protection against harsh weather, ideal for protective membranes. Semi-permeable barriers allow some moisture vapor to escape while blocking liquid water, balancing breathability and protection, suitable for building envelopes. Permeable barriers permit both air and moisture to flow freely, promoting ventilation and drying, often used in less harsh climates or interior applications to maintain indoor air quality.</p></p>
