<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Premium Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive premium tires market includes two main types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires are constructed with crisscrossed layers of rubber-coated fabric plies, offering durability and strength, ideal for heavy-duty applications but with less flexibility and comfort. Radial tires feature plies arranged perpendicular to the direction of travel, providing better fuel efficiency, smoother rides, and improved handling due to reduced heat buildup. Radial tires dominate the premium market due to their superior performance and longevity, while bias tires are niche, catering to specific rugged-use scenarios.</p></p>
