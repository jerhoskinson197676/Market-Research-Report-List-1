<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Seatbelt Pre-tensioner System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pre-tightening</li><li>Pre-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Seatbelt Pre-tensioner System market includes two primary types: Pre-tightening and Pre-roll systems. Pre-tightening systems activate during collisions, instantly retracting the seatbelt to minimize occupant movement and enhance safety. Pre-roll systems, on the other hand, engage preemptively during sudden braking or potential crash scenarios, tightening the seatbelt before impact to reduce injury risks. Both systems aim to improve passenger safety by ensuring optimal seatbelt tension, but they differ in activation timing and response mechanisms.</p></p>
