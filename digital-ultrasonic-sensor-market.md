<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Ultrasonic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retro-Reflective Sensor</li><li>Through Beam Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital ultrasonic sensor market features two primary types: retro-reflective sensors and through beam sensors. Retro-reflective sensors detect objects by emitting ultrasonic waves that reflect off a target back to the sensor, making them ideal for short-range applications. In contrast, through beam sensors utilize a pair of sensors—one emitting and the other receiving ultrasonic waves—creating a detection zone that can cover greater distances. Both types are widely used in automation, robotics, and industrial applications for precise object detection and distance measurement.</p></p>
