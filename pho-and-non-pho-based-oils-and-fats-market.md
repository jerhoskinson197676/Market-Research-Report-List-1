The rise in the demand for plant-based food products and clean-label ingredients further supports this growth.</p><p>Additionally, the food industry is evolving with trends like the clean eating movement, increased use of sustainable and organic oils, and innovation in oil processing technologies. This evolution signals a broader transition towards healthier, more sustainable alternatives in cooking and food manufacturing, underscoring the importance of non-PHO oils in today's market.</p></p>
