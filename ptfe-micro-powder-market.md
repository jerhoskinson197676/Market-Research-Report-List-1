<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTFE Micro Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>The original raw material</li><li>Reworked material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTFE micro powder market is categorized into two main types: original raw material and reworked material. The original raw material refers to virgin PTFE that has not been previously processed, offering high purity and consistent quality for applications like coatings, lubricants, and composites. In contrast, reworked material involves recycled PTFE, which, while often less expensive, may vary in quality and performance. This type caters to cost-sensitive applications where absolute purity is less critical, enabling efficient resource utilization.</p></p>
